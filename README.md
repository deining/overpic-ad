overpic â€“ Combine LaTeX commands over included graphics
=======================================================

The overpic environment is a cross between the LaTeX picture
environment and the \includegraphics command of graphicx. The
resulting picture environment has the same dimensions as the included
graphic. LaTeX commands can be placed on the graphic at defined positions;
a grid for orientation is available.

Recommended TDS locations:
