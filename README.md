overpic â€“ Combine LaTeX commands over included graphics
=======================================================

The overpic environment is a combination between the LaTeX picture
environment and another LaTeX object like an image used with the
command \cmd{\includegraphics} of graphicx or a tabular. The
resulting picture environment has the same dimensions as the included
object. LaTeX commands can be placed on the object at any position;
setting a grid for the orientation is possible.

Recommended TDS locations:
```
  overpic.sty:                          tex/latex/overpic
  README.md, README.de.md, overpic.pdf: doc/latex/overpic
```
For general installation advice, see

The overpic package is also on CTAN:[macros/latex/contrib/overpic](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/overpic)
