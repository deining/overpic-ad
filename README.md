overpic – Combine LaTeX commands over included graphics
=======================================================

The over­pic en­vi­ron­ment is a cross be­tween the LaTeX pic­ture
en­vi­ron­ment and the \in­clude­graph­ics com­mand of graph­icx. The
re­sult­ing pic­ture en­vi­ron­ment has the same di­men­sions as the in­cluded
graphic. LaTeX com­mands can be placed on the graphic at de­fined po­si­tions;
a grid for ori­en­ta­tion is avail­able.
